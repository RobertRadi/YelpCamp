Tools and Technologies:
Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, AJAX
Back-end: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongo Atlas)
User Authentification & Authorization: Passport.js
Image Upload: Cloudinary
Map & Geocoding: Mapbox
Deploying App: Heroku

You can watch the deployed application here:https://yelpcamptest2021.herokuapp.com/
